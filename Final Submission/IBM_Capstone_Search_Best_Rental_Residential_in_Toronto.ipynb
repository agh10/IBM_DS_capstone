    "       The below Data exploration project is developed as a part of IBM DataScience Capstone project. This is a final project of a 9 course professional certificate that aimed at providing intermediate knowledge of Data Science. The scope of the project is to Frame a business question around any city in the world , use the public data available for the city . Clean the data as required and further utilize Foursquare client API to explore the Business query about that city.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Foursquare client API is a social location service that provides real time access to foursquare client global database. The database has rich information about venue and user ratings. \n",
    "          \n",
    "          For my project below as suggested in the course, I have created a hypothetical business query in Toronto city. I will be getting all the relavent neighbourhood data from public datasets , clean and prepare this data  and further explore the data to understand the city's neighbourhoods to answer my business questions.

    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "      Toronto is not only the financial hub and largest populated city of Canada, It is also one of cities which is vouched for real estate investments in the world. Toronto real-estate market rise around 20% every year.Many entreprenaurs and even mid sized investors prefer to set  their rental business in neighbourhoods of Toronto. The neighbourhood of the business would impact ROI and Hence the investors would prefer to set up their properties near Universities, Tourist Places, Job hub and better school districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context\n",
    "\n",
    "      A is a mid size real estate investor and is looking to invest in residential properties to rent in Toronto.He is mainly looking into Condo properties as he thinks temporary tenants prefer economical condos in main city more than others as they provide sufficient space and less maintainence.He wants us Data scientists team ,to explore various neighbourhoods of Toronto and understand which neighbourhood would give him best ROI. The main objective of Mr A is that , the properties should not be vacant for more than 3 months and also he preferes tenants who dont live more than 2 years in a stretch in same condo for maintainence purposes. With this given criteria , we would target neighbourhoods with universities , school districts . He is also open to rent the property to temporary visitors . Hence a center location with easy public accessiblity to other venues is pereferable. \n",
    "\n",
    "     Summary :\n",
    "     - Which neighbourhood has universities ,schools and other colleges that would attract floating population to rent houses in that area\n",
    "     - What is the public travel accessiblity rating of the neighbourhood? How far is it from bus terminal, train stop or others?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytic Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "     To answer the above business query we would ,\n",
    "     - We would get the list of neighbourhoods of Toronto city.\n",
    "     - We would consider only those neighbourhoods which have university/colleges/schools within a specific radius of distance. \n",
    "     - We would check the public transit stops/stations in the area.\n",
    "     - From the result , we will choose the best list of neighbourhoods based on their aggregated score .\n",
    "     - Further we will cluster the above neighbourhoods list and recommend the cluster that hat Mr A can invest on\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the process , we plan to use python and pandas for retrieving and preparing the dataset.For clustering we will be using popular k-means algorithm. For generating visualization maps we will use Folium. Also  , we are using Four square API ( public location service) to get the venues.\n"

    "     3. We will be using four square client to get all the near by venues for the updated list of neighbourhoods of Toronto that we get after data cleaning .\n",
    "     4. We are planning to use only few categories of venues from four square venue category list to keep the data limited to our specific business query only. Below are those:\n",
